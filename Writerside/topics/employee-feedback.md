# Enhanced Employee Feedback Strategy

## Overview and Strategic Approach
OuterBox is considering a strategy to deeply integrate feedback into our daily operations. The aim is to create an environment where feedback drives growth, with a focus on developing channels for anonymous yet accountable feedback and rewarding the act of feedback giving. This strategy is central to fostering a culture of openness, trust, and continuous improvement.

## Ideas for Achieving the Goal

### Points-Based Reward System for Feedback
Integrating a feedback platform like Bonusly could serve as the foundation for rewarding employees for providing feedback. This system would offer points for each piece of feedback given, with additional rewards for feedback that peers find particularly valuable. This dual incentive aims to encourage a culture of constructive communication and recognition.

**Suggested KPIs**: Number of feedback submissions; employee participation rate in the feedback system.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 5. Setting up a platform requires technical setup and cultural buy-in.

**Human Resources and Time**: Implementation would involve HR and IT for setup, taking around 3-3.75 months to fully integrate into daily operations.

### Anonymity with Accountability in Feedback
Employing tools like Officevibe or Culture Amp can offer a way to collect anonymous feedback, ensuring honesty while maintaining accountability through structured feedback mechanisms. This approach balances the need for open dialogue with the requirement for feedback to be constructive and actionable.

**Suggested KPIs**: Quality and actionability of feedback received; employee trust in the anonymity of feedback tools.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 6. Balancing anonymity with actionable insights presents challenges.

**Human Resources and Time**: Requires HR to manage and monitor feedback, expected to take 4-5 months for full implementation and cultural adaptation.

### Regular Engagement Forums
Hosting virtual town halls and interactive Q&A sessions can serve as regular platforms for leadership to engage with employees, discuss feedback, and outline action plans. These forums are intended to ensure that every employee feels heard and sees how their input contributes to organizational changes.

**Suggested KPIs**: Employee engagement in forums; actionable outcomes derived from discussions.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 7. Regular scheduling and ensuring meaningful interaction are complex.

**Human Resources and Time**: Involves coordination by HR and leadership, estimated to take 4-6 months to establish as a regular part of OuterBox culture.

## Expected Outcomes
The strategy aims to significantly enhance employee engagement by valuing their feedback and acting upon it, thereby improving organizational agility and employee retention. We anticipate this will foster a culture of innovation and mutual respect, contributing positively to OuterBox's reputation as a top employer in the digital marketing industry.
