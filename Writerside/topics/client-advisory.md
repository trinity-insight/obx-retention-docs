# Client Advisory Board

## Overview and Strategic Approach
OuterBox is currently evaluating the concept of a Client Advisory Board (CAB) as a means to engage key clients for insights and strategic guidance. This initiative is planned to involve clients in shaping our services and strategies, aiming to enhance client satisfaction and inform our business decisions.

## Ideas for Achieving the Goal

### Composition and Recruitment
Creating a diverse CAB with members from different industries, company sizes, and regions is the aim to capture varied perspectives. This initiative would target clients who are highly engaged and visionary, with the understanding that their involvement would be mutually beneficial.

**Suggested KPIs**: Diversity of industries represented; member engagement levels.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 6. Finding and securing the commitment of diverse, qualified members can be challenging.

**Human Resources and Time**: Requires a team for recruitment and management, potentially taking around 3-4 months considering the additional time suggested.

### Meeting Structure
Regular quarterly meetings of the CAB are envisioned, with the possibility of additional sessions for urgent strategy discussions. These meetings would be structured to encourage a balanced exchange of updates and open dialogue, facilitated professionally.

**Suggested KPIs**: Number of strategic initiatives influenced by CAB; participant satisfaction with meeting structure.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 7. Organizing and facilitating meetings that generate valuable insights are complex.

**Human Resources and Time**: Involves organizing by a dedicated team, likely extending to 5-6 months to establish an effective routine.

### Technology and Tools
A plan to use advanced video conferencing tools for interactive CAB meetings and a digital workspace for ongoing collaboration and feedback is being considered.

**Suggested KPIs**: Uptime of technology tools; user satisfaction ratings.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 5. Technology deployment and adoption can be unpredictable.

**Human Resources and Time**: IT support and training roles required, estimated at 3-4 months to implement fully.

### Incentivization for High-Quality Feedback
#### Exclusive Benefits
Offering CAB members early access to new products and personal strategy sessions is an idea being explored to show appreciation for their insights.

**Suggested KPIs**: Level of actionable feedback received; CAB member satisfaction with exclusive benefits.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 4. Structuring and managing exclusive benefits is relatively straightforward.

**Human Resources and Time**: Likely managed by client relations and product teams, taking about 2-3 months to operationalize.

#### Anonymity and Openness
The plan includes creating a safe space for honest feedback, potentially through anonymous contributions, to ensure open and genuine discussions.

**Suggested KPIs**: Volume of feedback provided; quality and candor of insights.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 6. Encouraging candid feedback while preserving anonymity adds complexity.

**Human Resources and Time**: Requires oversight by client relations, possibly taking 3-4 months to establish trust and processes.

#### Recognition and Impact
Introducing a "Client Impact Score" to measure the influence of CAB feedback on OuterBox's decisions is under consideration.

**Suggested KPIs**: Adoption rate of CAB suggestions; awareness of the impact score among CAB members.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 3. Integrating this within existing processes is less complex.

**Human Resources and Time**: Execution by the client relations and marketing team, expected to take about 1-2 months.

#### Ongoing Engagement
Ensuring ongoing engagement with CAB members through regular updates and communications is another component of this plan.

**Suggested KPIs**: Frequency of interactions; engagement metrics.

**Difficulty To Implement**: 5. Maintaining regular and meaningful communication requires consistent effort.

**Human Resources and Time**: Handled by client relations and marketing, likely to extend to 3-4 months to build a sustainable engagement program.

## Expected Outcomes
The establishment of a CAB is anticipated to lead to stronger client engagement and retention by involving them in strategic discussions. By directly incorporating client feedback, service offerings can be improved, fostering increased satisfaction and loyalty. A CAB would also cement OuterBox's reputation as a client-focused organization, and internally, it would nurture a culture where client insights are integral to decision-making.
